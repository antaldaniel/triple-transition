## Policy Agenda Introduction (Dr Joost Poort)

After the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers in Europe increasingly discuss the strategic public policy agenda under the 'triple transition' term, which refers to approaches in climate issues ("green transition"), technology ("digital transition") and the underlying shape of its society ("social transition"). We will use this terminology because it is highly relevant to our work, and it is used the same with in Slovakia and the other countries where we do research. Since the " triple transition" is a top-level and horizontal policy framework, we can also discuss the Slovak cultural strategy (together with two other Slovak policies, the digitisation strategy and the sustainable development goals for the country) in a shared framework with the EU policies. We can easily adjust the Slovak policy document's contents under these terms.

The "triple transition" is highly relevant to our work because these horizontal policies guide public investment, have new rules on private investment spending, and foresee changes in economic and tax policies. The EU's cultural programme Creative Europe already follows the triple transition framework, and it is relatively easy to imagine the Slovak cultural strategy 2030 in this framework, too, or to map our Open Music Europe research program and its work packages and work tasks in this format.

![Schema of the European Growth Model](jpg/comnat_COM_2022_0083_FIN.ENG.xhtml.COM_2022_0083_FIN_ENG_02002.jpg){fig-align="center"}

We reviewed three Slovak policy documents for our work which are relevant: the sectorial *Stratégia kultúry a kreatívneho priemyslu Slovenskej republiky 2030* (henceforth: **Slovak CCI Strategy**), the *Slovakia's Vision and Development Strategy 2030 - a long-term strategy for sustainable development* [@slovak_sdg_strategy_2020]---henceforth: **Slovak Strategic SDGs**, which has significant cultural elements, and the *2030 Digital Transformation Strategy for Slovakia* [@2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_en_2019; @2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_sk_2019]--henceforth: **Slovak Digitisation Strategy**, which is highly relevant for the innovation we are doing in Slovakia under the label "Listen Local" in WP2.3. These documents were made in different years, and they are consistent with the EU policy document of that given year; they show little cross-referencing however within the Slovak documents. This means that for example, the most dated Slovak Digitisation Strategy is having no reference to the cultural and creative industries at all, but also, the later *Slovak CCI Strategy* has very little concrete reference to the SDG policies and no reference to the Slovak Digitisation Strategy. The *Slovak CCI Strategy* is a well-designed policy paper, and it is easy to link to the relevant, horizontal SGD and digitisation policies.

The "triple transition" is highly relevant to our work because these horizontal policies guide public investment, have new rules on private investment spending, and foresee changes in economic and tax policies. It immediately connects with the 2nd strategic priority of the *Slovak CCI Strategy*, **2 Efficiently funded culture** to systematically reduce the infrastructure and modernisation gap, increase the efficiency of the finance management and financing of culture and creative industries, and complement public funding sources with private sources.

The following KPIs of this strategic objective are very relevant to our work.

| KPI          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| SK CCI `2e`  | Reduction of investment gap in the culture sector compared to investment needs at baseline, which foresees a 640-million-euro excess investment till 2030. This is relevant for our *Music economy* and *Sustainability* pillars.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `2a`         | Share of value added of culture and creative industries in the value added of the economy, which is projected to grow at a higher rate than the Slovak economy. This is a key interest in our *Music economy* research.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `2c`, `2d`   | Share of own revenues, which are expected to grow. The growth of revenues in the music industry is a key target for all our research, including *Innovation,* too*.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `3a`         | Share of employment in culture and creative industries in the total economy is the most prioritized part of our measurement, because the higher level value added is mainly determined by labor input.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `3b`         | Number of male and female employees in the cultural and creative industry. Number of self-employed persons in the culture and creative industries. These measurements are central to the *Music economy pillar* and the *gender equality* component of social sustainability is part of *Open Music Europe.* It is also an important meeting point with the Slovak strategic sustainable development goals (SDGs).  |
| `3d`         | Average income in culture and creative industries; number of industries lagging behind the national economy average value are part of our *Music economy* pillar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `3e`         | Average wages of professional men and women in the cultural and creative industries as a proportion of the national average wage of university-educated men and women in the national economy; this indicator connects to CEEMID background of our project and in our opinion requires consultation, because most of the music industry workforce is not educated on university level.                              |

: Music economy and green transition; the environmental targets will be shown in the sustainability framework

In line with the policy objective of the *Slovak CCI Strategy*, the reduction of the investment gap and a subsequent structural reform that increases revenues and value-added require additional funding outside of the Slovak public treasury. To meet the target value of the outcome indicators, good investments must be made, preferably financed from the EU budget or Recovery and Resilience Facility (RFF) funds or private sources. Since investments take time to increase revenues and value-added, the time is now to participate in the triple transition.

The triple transition is an excellent opportunity for the CCSIs, particularly the music industry, to become more competitive, sustainable and resilient. They can more easily meet the requirements for sustainable financing than most industries and turn their previous disadvantage in attracting financing into an advantage. On the public policy level, if we can help the Slovak CCSIs meet the requirements for these massive investments, the Slovak cultural policy can mobilise apart from the limited national public budgets, significant EU public investment and private investment. This way, the means of the current Slovak cultural strategy can be increased.

Many horizontal EU measures, ranging from the sustainable finance package to competition and consumer protection rules aim to make more sustainable investments and operations more profitable, and make less sustainable or brown activities less profitable. The Creative Europe program or the RFF facility are already programmed under the triple transition agenda. As a consequence, `Open Music Europe` wants to bring sustainability out of its silo and mainstream it into its music economics research and policy recommendations.

We want to introduce innovations on two levels: the use of data as policy-evidence, which can directly help the policy control of the Slovak strategic with indicators, and data and metadata innovations, which can help Slovak music or other cultural institutions and businesses to implement on micro-level these priorities.

Open Music Europe supports with five substantial work packages the music industry, but we work with problems that are sometimes almost identically appearing in other creative industries, or even in any service industry. We think that the Slovak government can treat or project and its music stakeholders as a laboratory where the music industry can show the way for other creative industries, and sometimes for broader sustainability or digitisation policies.

We started our work to review the state of the data infrastructure, procedures and data needs in the field of *music economy*, which correspond to Slovak CCI strategy goals `2` and `3` (see the economic KPIs in the table above.) Instead of developing new indicators, we realised that the biggest methodological innovation would be the development of these indicators for the music industry itself.

Perhaps a bit surprisingly, we place now the following KPIs under the *green transition* agenda, because we believe that the necessary structural reforms in that area go hand-in-hand with these objectives, strictly in a creative economics point of view. Until 2030 in Europe the most likely financing source to meet the following KPIs is public and private sustainable finance.

Slovakia already invested into a cultural satellite account system, which is an excellent step towards designing and reviewing CCSI policies on the macro level, however, they do not offer a solution for implementation, which happens necessarily on the level of music businesses, collective management societies like SOZA, or in architecture bureaus, or in film production companies.  The top level, aggregated CCI indicators are not helpful for an architecture association or SOZA to design actions towards the goals, they can only influence a part of music.  Also, if the indicators are not developing into the right direction, currently the IKP has no means to find out if architecture, film, or music is lagging behind. Therefore, we believe that the next step to create an actionable plan for the Slovak music industry as best example, and then for other industries like film or architecture, is re-create the aggregated CCI-level macroindicators for the music industry, then create their enterprise- and institutional level corresponding figures.

The KPIs that were reviewed so far show a critical missing link in the strategy document and its successful implementation. The KPIs the ministry uses are based on a satellite account, which has a macroeconomic view that none of the cultural sector institutions or creative businesses can relate to directly. The current Slovak satellite accounts do not produce indicators for the music industry, audiovisual industry, film industry, or architecture. However, raising the investment or employment/income component of the GDP requires very different actions in the music industry and architecture, for example. There are no common institutions, and there are no cross-cutting enterprises that are present in both music and architecture. For a practical translation of the outcome indicators into actionable and measurable steps, we need indicators for the music industry, the film industry, and architecture, just as banking, insurance, or car manufacturing have them.

When discussing our novel approaches to closing the data gaps of the music economy, we are not reinventing the wheel. Our first recommendation is that we need those top-line indicators for the music industry that would come on the top of the head of any policymaker, like share in the GDP or total male and female employment or average wage. We will also suggest a few industry-specific indicators, but mainly not connected to the economy.

Having such indicators is not self-explanatory or easy. Most EU countries still need a cultural satellite account like Slovakia has, and even though Slovakia invested in this tool, it still needs to produce indicators for the music or film industry. However, these indicators could help successful RFF or Creative Europe applications from the music or film industry, which would be required to make successful loans or investment proposals towards private funds. They would be required to make good investments that increase productivity and can lift personal incomes, too.

Creating industry-level and enterprise/institutional level KPIs would enable industry cooperation of the music industry, and eventually individual music companies, or SOZA, or Hudobné centrum to add their part to the implementation of the strategy. It would also enable the ministry to have a controlling means on implementation, because the current, aggregated, all-industry indicators do not allow giving feedback on individual actions like regulatory changes or grant calls.

`Open Music Europe` offers novel data uses, data collection techniques and other innovations to create such indicators. The national accounts system, which is the source of most economic statistics, does not cover the creative and cultural sectors and industries (CCSI) well and certainly does not create indicators for the music industry, film industry, or architecture. There are multiple historical reasons for this which we will elaborate more on in our research papers, but whatever has been the chain of events, neither the economic activity (ISIC-NACE) nor the occupational codes (ISCO-ESCO) are well-defined to sort out data that is already there in the Slovak statistical system. In most cases, the music industry, the film industry, or the architecture data arrives in the form of questionnaire-based surveys or so-called administrative sources, such as anonymous tax return data. It is impossible to tell which data point belongs to musicians or music technicians.

1.  In the first interactive session, Daniel Antal, CFA, will explain the necessary data organisation and cooperation to achieve these goals. Such innovations would allow the connection of official, mandatory statistics via the open data and open science regulations of the EU to connect to a voluntary, connecting data collection (both from surveys and so-called administrative sources, i.e., databases of the music industry that were originally not designed for statistical purposes, but can produce statistics).

2.  In the second interactive session, James Edwards, PhD, will talk about how we would like connect with ex ante and ex post harmonisation to Slovak survey programs, Eurostat's AES, EU-SILC and the Commission's Eurobarometer survey programs, and our own surveys.

3.  In the third interactive session, Mgr. Tomas Miks will introduce an initiative of SOZA to work with other industry stakeholders, most notably with the Hudonbne centrum, to modernise public archive catalogues and create interoperability with musicians' accounts. The concept of Listen Local and the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database could be an industry-specific data infrastructure for non-survey data.

## Open Policy Analysis, Open Statistics & Open Science (Daniel Antal)

## Open Policy Analysis 

Quality data is expensive to produce: for example, the most significant part of the cost burden of making government statistics is carried by the enterprises who must fill out questionnaires or provide other data for their creation. It is not desirable or financially feasible to have parallel government, policy analysis or market research surveys; therefore, the Data Governance Act and the Open Data Directive, along with the funding guidelines and regulations of scientific research funding, call for open access to all taxpayer-funded data.

The Open Policy Analysis and the FAIR standards of open science correspond well with the EU's Digital Europe program and Data strategy. Because data should be open, it takes data-driven, evidence-based policymaking a step further, requesting other documents that use the data (such as working documents to form hypotheses and the actual data analysis and interpretation) to be transparent and open, too.

Our main innovation in Open Music Europe is the creation of a prototype European Music Observatory, with a strong focus on Slovakia, that contains government, scientific, and private data to design better public and business policies or indicators for controlling their management.

First, we would like to discuss our innovative idea about joining open government, open science and private data in the innovative data observatory concept. More than 60 observatories are present in Europe, but they were mainly designed following 20th-century, centralised principles and need to integrate better with open government data or private, proprietary data. Our concept, which we developed in a data management task and partly in our music economics task, wants to connect these three data realms and create music industry satellite accounts and science-based, mandatory sustainability management targets in a public-private partnership.

## Public-private partnership for music satellite account

![Schema of the proposed coordinated government and private data collection and (re)use](jpg/wp1_schema.jpg)

The critical element of our proposal is the Slovak Music Industry Register, which would allow the harmonisation of survey administration and so-called "administrative data", and the reuse of survey microdata and "administrative data", for example, data from SOZA's royalty accounts or Hudonbné centrum archives. The SMIR would allow the separation of a music account in the satellite accounts systems and fill in auxiliary data about music that may not be present.

The creative industries are informal-, micro- and small enterprises, and they are not well covered in the Roc-2 surveys. All large enterprises fill out the Roc-1 surveys, but only 2 music enterprises fall into this category in Slovakia. The Roc-2 survey is filled out by some randomly selected enterprises every year. It is unlikely that more than a handful of music businesses get into this sample, so even if we were able to separate the microdata from the responses filled in by music enterprises, the number of responses from the music industry would not be sufficient to create reliable estimates of gross value added, GDP components or employment. Because Roc-2 uses NACE codes to identify the economic activities of the enterprises, and the music or film industry has no NACE code, we need the SKMIR to create this data subset.

The SKMIR would be, similarly to what architecture statistics often do, a list of enterprise identifiers that fall into the music industry. With this reference data, the Statistical Office could separate responses from the music industry, say, 11 responses, and we could randomly ask 39 enterprises to fill out the Roc-2 form. Using "small area statistics" techniques would allow us to prepare the data for a music industry satellite account and make the indicators.

The creative industries are informal-, micro- and small enterprises, and they are not well covered in the `Roč 2-01` surveys. All large enterprises fill out the `Roč 1-01` surveys, but only two or three music enterprises fall into this category in Slovakia. The `Roč 2-01` survey is filled out by some randomly selected enterprises every year. Here the problem is that it is unlikely that more than a handful of music businesses get into this sample, so even if we were able to separate the microdata from the responses filled in by music enterprises, the number of responses from the music industry would not be sufficient to create reliable estimates of gross value added, GDP components or employment. The `Roč 2-01` would need to be oversampled in the music sector to allow the creation of the music satellite account, and this is exactly what we could do with the SKMIR.

Because `Roč 2-01` uses NACE codes to identify the economic activities of the enterprises, and the music or film industry has no NACE code, we need the SKMIR to create the data subset from already submitted answers, and see how much further datapoint (filled out questionnaires) we would need on a voluntary basis to reach the minimum quote for a music industry account. The Statistical Office could separate responses from the music industry, say, 11 responses, and we could randomly ask 39 enterprises to fill out the `Roč 2-01` form. Using "small area statistics" techniques would allow us to prepare the data for a music industry satellite account and make the indicators.

Taking this a step further, we could follow Slovakia's same methodological guidelines since 2010 about the coverage of the informal economy in the LFS survey, an important data source of employment and income statistics (objective 3). We could design a simplified version of `Roč 2-01` , `Roč 3-01` for personal administration of one-person and informal enterprises. Or, by adding 1-2 qualifier questions to the protocol variable list of LFS, statisticians and researchers can take out the music or film industry questionnaires from all filled-out questionnaires and create the indicator. (The LFS is perhaps the most important source, and it uses both NACE and ESCO codes, but ESCO codes also do not cover the music or film industry professional roles.)

### Green Transition, Effective Funding, Dignified Culture

The EU **green transition** policy and the *European Green Deal* offers huge investments into restructuring the current service model and supply chain more sustainably. This is one area where the *Slovak Strategic SDGs* and the *Slovak CCI Strategy* should be jointly followed, but not only with a "green eye".

We do not only connect the *green transition* with the *Slovak CCI Strategy* objective `7 Responsible culture`, but also with `2 Effectively funded culture` and `3 A dignified culture`. In line with our own assessment, we believe that CCSIs, and the music industry are no different, creating value in a highly labour-intensive way. They use mainly human input and intellectual property as intangible capital and use less tangible capital than the typical Slovak economic sector. Whether we want to increase the *gross value added* or the *gross domestic product*, the CCSIs will likely increase the value-added or domestic product via the income generated by their labour, intellectual property and capital investments. Furthermore, because of the sector's high level of informality and fragmentation, persona and mixed-income will contribute more to the value-added and domestic product than corporate income.

Consequently, indicators to help develop and control strategic objective 2 will only work with the employment-focused objective 3. Our *Economy of music in Europe: Novel data collection methods and indicators* [@antal_et_al_2023] places a huge emphasis on employment and personal income because we believe that it is not only a desirable strategic objective to increase their values, but they are essential to meet the more general funding and value-added targets, too.

Our proposals related to the `WP1 Music Economy Pillar` of `Open Music Europe` offer more data management, estimation, and fusion innovations than inventions of new fancy indicators. We suggest a novel public-private partnership that can connect open government data with open science data and invest in a more actionable, usable satellite account system that includes the music industry. We believe that our efforts can be replicated with very little or no cost to other copyright-based industries or often to other service industries, too; in this regard, the music industry can play the role of laboratory to implement data and measurements innovations in the broad CCSI or even the service sectors. These suggestions will be the topic of Session 1.

Strategic Priority `7.2` Support the creation, production, dissemination and visibility of sustainable products and projects in the cultural and creative industries should be more emphasised, and we should develop its own indicators (as there is no real KPI addressing this priority.)

-   On the level of regulation and technical assistance, we must ensure that the Slovak CCSIs meet the requirements for sustainable financing, particularly the reporting and disclosure rules of the CSRD directive, and we will be developing tools for this in WP3 and WP4 of Open Music Europe. We will be the topic of Session 2.

-   On the level of CCSI public policy and music economics, we need to be able to locate, record, and analyse data about how the value chain works, i.e., where and how much value added is created. These problems relate to our WP1 and WP4 and will be the topic of Session 1.

-   As a result, we hope to see increased personal, company and tax income and increased productivity and competitiveness of the Slovak music industry. This work is almost fully transferable to other CCSIs, particularly copyright-based industries such as film or media.

Measuring elements of social sustainability intersect with the economic/labour policy goals of reducing informality at work and increasing the visibility of Slovak culture abroad at home. We will discuss these topics in Session 2 and 3.

### Social Transition

The **social transition** entails many things, and in `Open Music Europe`, we chose a few of them which are particularly important for the music industry. The problem of informality, or the prevalence of informal working relations and informal enterprises in music, is relevant for the music economy and its social sustainability because working conditions, social protection and anti-discrimination measures are far more difficult or impossible to monitor and enforce in the informal economy.

Under the `WP3 Sustainability pillar`, we want to pilot survey-based indicators that fulfil the requirements set by draft ESRS, the currently drafted European Sustainability Reporting Standards. Like in the case of the economy, most of our innovation is going beyond finding new indicators but finding ways to produce them at scale and a reasonable cost. This requires survey harmonisation and, again, innovation in data production. While ESRS involves the invention of new indicators, the most critical indicators are defined by the standard itself, yet they had never been measured in the Slovak CCSIs.

Regarding KPIs, the *Slovak CCSI Strategy* in some cases requires separate indicators for women and men, and also involves some objectives for national minorities, and for people with different sexual appearance or with a migration background. Providing impact assessment for these groups is also mandatory under ESRS for the own workforce, for suppliers and affected communities, and they should be creatively harmonized with Cultural Access and Participation surveying and mixed-mode labour force surveying.

Survey harmonisation is essential to meet the social sustainability measurement challenges, but it is also necessary for measuring demand in our Music economy pillar. Our project and its background in the CEEMID project have the most to offer to the policymakers in this field. The *Slovak CCI Strategy* document is based on a single Cultural Access and Participation survey, while our project partners have conducted more detailed CAP surveys in Slovakia in 2015 and 2020. Also, we have developed ways to retrospectively harmonise CAP survey blocks from other EU surveys, such as Eurobarometer, AES and EU-SILC. Unlike most strategic objectives, strategic objective `6 Respected culture` fully and `7 xxx` partly rely on the current CAP surveying that the Slovak statistical system currently cannot offer. Our project can provide new measurements and retrospective harmonisation for existing measures going back at least 20 years for the following KPIs.

-   `KPI 6a` Active cultural participation of the population/interested artistic activity, reference value from 2015 is 9,3 %. We can offer further history to this KPI, not only artistic activity, but separately for various artisitc activities, such as playing a music instrument, singing or acting.
-   `KPI 6b` Passive cultural participation of the population 59 % (2015); again, we can offer further historic data and new measurements.
-   `KPI 6c` Public perception of the importance of culture---we have some historic data and we can pilot better measurement.
-   `KPI 6d` Attendance at public collections 3 086 980 (2020); we can offer more historic data and also methodological advise how to better measure this KPI.
-   `KPI 6e` Percentage of citizens with a library card 5,94 % (2020) 17,80 %---we have related data for many years, and we believe that this KPI could be better measured with standardised EU indicators.
-   `KPI 6f` Attendance at performing arts institutions 590 559 (2020)---we could make a case study of the measurement problems and show data not only for music, but various forms of arts.
-   `KPI 6g` Attendance at festivals (theatre, music, film festivals, shows, non professional culture competitions, etc.) 367 923 (2020)---we have ample experience in this field and we could further develop the questionnaire here, because festival- and non-festival like performances are often overlapping.
-   `KPI 6h` Aggregate attendance at cultural institutions 7 799 806 (2021)---we have experience and data to improve this estimate and break it down to cultural sectors.
-   `KPI 7c` Percentage of citizens who trust the media---we can provide a long historical data series for this and we can include it in our measurement.
-   `KPI 7d` Percentage of the population that has no reservations about a neighbour from another culture---we can provide a long historical data series for this and we can include it in our measurement.
-   `KPI 7g` Percentage of the population who agree that other people can be---this relates to our earlier experiments (not yet published, low hanging fruit), where we can provide data, generally about the usefulness of moving from a strictly socio-demographic model of CAP surveying to a partly psychometric model.

*We have experimented with an extended sociology-demography that includes trust and psychometric trait variables, and we can show that, for example, the differences in cultural participation often attributed to gender are caused by specific psychometric properties to be more prevalent among female respondents*.

### Digital Transition, Quality Culture, Dignified Culture

The **digital transition** is a crucial European and Slovak policy which so far has been isolated on the Slovak level from the cultural strategy. The official digitisation strategy of Slovakia does not say a single word about the CCSIs and has no cultural or creative industry-specific priorities or actions.

In the post-Covid economy, often named the "platform economy", the informal work typical in music for at least ten years (since we measure it) appeared outside the cultural sector in many parts of the Slovak economy. Our measurement innovations and proposals are relevant far beyond the scope of the music industry or CCSIs; the music industry can be a laboratory for highly relevant labour or tax policy work. Dealing with the problem of informality is very important for the green/economic and social transition, too, and essential to the challenges of digitisation.

The main policy of the digital transition on the level of the EU is the *Digital Europe Programme*[@eu_regulation_2021-694], which also takes up the second largest chunk of the EU and RFF budget after the green transition. The KPIs of this policy are measured in country reports by the European Commission. The country report on Slovakia and its Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) does not paint a rosy picture [@desi_slovakia_2022]. Slovakia as a country is among the lowest performers in digitisation, which critically threatens the competitiveness of the economy and meeting the Slovak strategic SDG goals.

Out of the three reviewed Slovak national policies, the most dated one is the *Slovak Digitalisation Strategy*, written in a very optimistic tone in 2019. At the time, the predecessor of our project started the Listen Local Slovakia demonstration project and created our *Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia & Abroad* [@antal_promoting_slovak_2020; @antal_promoting_slovak_2020-SK]. This music-industry-specific study and demonstration can be seen as an industry-specific experiment meeting the real-life challenges of the digitisation strategy, particularly the digitisation challenges of SMEs. As opposed to the optimistic tone of the *Slovak Digitalisation Strategy*, we had shown that digitisation did not increase; on the contrary, it may have even decreased the competitiveness of the Slovak music industry. Slovak music businesses and individual creators met the digitisation challenges of SMEs earlier than most of the Slovak economy because they had to move their retail sales to global platforms, such as YouTube, Spotify, or Apple, before 2019. On these platforms, sales are almost entirely robotised and driven by AI algorithms.

As we have shown in 2020, moving to global platforms increased the competition and has driven down prices. At the same time, enormous data skills were needed to collect micropayments. As a result, we showed in 2020 that about 17% of the Slovak repertoire present on global platforms could not even be found due to data problems, and at least 50% of the creators and their businesses missed payments due to data/metadata problems.

One of the primary motivations for bringing `Open Music Europe` together was that we could not find national funding to continue this critical work that has been used far beyond the music industry; we believe that it could be a testing laboratory for all copyright-based CCSIs, and to many other service industries. Global platforms are in the hands of the world's most giant corporations, which employ an army of data engineers and scientists. On the other hand, to work with them as equal and not exploited partners, it is not reasonable to expect that every Slovak SME or music business can hire their own data engineer or data scientist. Our main idea with the creation of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database and Listen Local, and in a broader sense, with the Slovak Music Industry Register, is to initiate national data public-private partnerships and support the Slovak SMEs with data and data know-how to meet collectively the challenges of the digital economy.

Apart from the contribution to the earlier mentioned goals to an effectively funded and a dignified culture (which collects a larger share of own revenues and able to finance its sustainable growth) this project element can also contribute to the hard-to measure indicators in strategic objective `4 Quality culture` and `5 Inclusive culture`.

-   `KPI 4g` Share of culture and creative industries exports in total exports.

-   `KPI 4e` Number of works or authors who have been successful in international competitions (cultural heritage, literature, audiovisual and design)

-   `KPI 5d` Share of broadcasting for national minorities in public service media---this should be made together with measuring Slovak shares in local public and private broadcast media and streaming ('radio quotas') and in export markets, too; the situation of Slovak music abroad, and often even at home is rather similar to the national minorities, because the majority of music used in commercial media is foreigh.

-   The creative industry, particularly the music industry, is far more digitised than the rest of the Slovak economy, according to the latest DESI assessment. Since the main sales configuration of music is music- and video streaming on global platforms, the Slovak music industry had to cope with far more accelerated digitisation than the rest of the economy.

-   The creation of the planned Slovak Comprehensive Music Database, the Slovak Music Industry Register, and our Listen Local program offer a way to simultaneously deal with significant cultural and digitisation policy challenges. We want to redesign the local content policies (i.e., radio quotas) for broadcasters to global streaming platforms to ensure a visible presence for Slovak music both within Slovakia and abroad.

## Session 3: Comprehensive Slovak Music Database, Listen Local (Tomaš Mikš) {#session3}

Our long-standing Listen Local project was one of the most immediate predecessors of the Open Music Europe project, which grew out of various CEEMID initiatives where we felt that we needed greater European cooperation and a more significant grant to progress.

Listen Local was initially intended to ensure that more local content is being played in restaurants and hotels. For example, if you walk into your favourite café in Bratislava, there is a chance that Slovak will hear Slovak music---and we do not have to send the royalties that are paid by your favourite cafe abroad. Or, if you walk into a restaurant in Košice, there is a chance that you hear some music from Košice. Local people and visitors can listen to local music; the money is not sent abroad or to Bratislava.

When the global streaming platforms appeared in the region, first in Hungary and Czechia, then in Slovakia and Bulgaria, after the initial euphoria of changing from piracy to a paid platform, local labels realised that these platforms would offer to the audience in both Bratislava and Košice music from abroad---mainly about 50 cities of the world out of which none is to be found within the European Union. Around this time, Slovakia introduced mandatory quotas for radios to leave some space for Slovak music.

In 2020, we attempted to consolidate these objectives into a comprehensive program that would help the musicians in Bratislava or Košice to be heard in restaurants, on the radio and streaming platforms. With a microgrant from the Slovak Arts Council, we developed the idea of a goal-based music recommender system and a supporting database, the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database. The resulting Feasibility Study and demo application is the basis of our diversity work package in Open Music Europe.

![](webp/listen_local_slovakia_publication.png)

There are two main problems with the simple quota regulation: It may reduce interest in Slovak music if not the appropriate Slovak music is added to the expected playlist of the listener. The radio editor, or the algorithm that creates the Spotify playlist, does not know what "Slovak music" is. Our demo application solved this with only 4,000 songs: we created an app allowing users to log in with their Spotify account. It changed the weekly recommendation of Spotify--- based on the user's taste--- with a desired number of Slovak music, with or without Slovak lyrics.

We envisioned at least three applications:

1.  An app which takes a pre-defined list, which maybe a radio station's summer rotation list, a restaurant's own playlist, or a Spotify or Deezer user's personal playlist, and adds relevant and fitting Slovak music to it.

2.  An application that works in general education and playfully helps music discovery. Starting from the child's favourite music, under parental and/or educator supervision, it walks the child through music from Bratislava and Košice, Czechia and Hungary, Europe, or back in time, touching on the national repertoire that the study program requires to familiarise with.

3.  An application that helps a musician, label or publisher find out which radio or streaming playlist or in which European country and city their music would most likely fit.

While designing this application, we analysed how global streaming platforms and their algorithms developed by Google, Apple and Spotify are recommending music. Contrary to general belief, they use the user's listening history for recommendations and much information about the music and the artist's biography. We also realised that they only recommend Slovak music if they find information about this music online. And what is worse, if they see or misunderstand information about a Slovak artist, they may recommend the artist's music in a completely inappropriate context, for example, in Thailand, where listeners will immediately shut off the music, giving it an adverse listening history and muting it forever. The algorithm will think that this is "bad music".

We see two cultural policy problems here that link to the issues of the digitisation agenda in general. First, unless we control and ensure that correct data is available on the "internet of data" layer of the Internet, where the computers of YouTube, Spotify, Wikipedia, and MusicBrainz talk to each other, we are at the mercy of their robots. It is better to create a correct Slovak Comprehensive Music Database and put it on the "Internet of data". Second, as we can see from the DESI scores of Slovakia, it cannot be expected that a small music label that is releasing new classical music with one person or a self-releasing artist can hire a data engineer to work on the "internet of data" layer of the Internet. This is the task of a national organisation or a national music library. Working with big data and interacting with YouTube or ChatGPT algorithms is impossible for a Slovak SME. Unless we take back control of the data they use and give meaningful data infrastructure support, Slovak music SMEs will lose their market in the digital space and not gain new ones.

What we try to build in Open Music Europe is directly useful for the Slovak music industry, but we believe that with very little modification, it could be useful for Slovak writers, filmmakers and other creators who are increasingly present in the digital space. As a next step, our framework and toolset, not Listen Local, can also be an essential case study on how to make the *Slovak Digitisation Strategy* more tangible in other sectors, particularly for SMEs, where, according to the DESI assessment, Slovakia is lagging behind Europe.

### Fit with the Slovak CCI Strategy

`2 Efficiently funded culture` to systematically reduce infrastructure and modernisation backlog and increase the efficiency of the management and financing of culture and creative industries, to complement public sources of funding with private sources. We cannot expect every SME to hire data engineers, web engineers and data scientists. Statistical offices, public archives, collective management modernise their services and provide gateways to the "internet of data".

`3 A dignified culture`, which aims to improve the working and creative conditions for people working in the cultural and creative industries. Listen Local was originally designed to help collecting online revenues which require advanced data/automatisation tools and data knowledge.

`4 Quality culture` to increase professionalism, innovation and quality in the cultural and creative industries. We think that **Listen Local** could be a use case for increasing professionalism and embracing innovatve tools, such as working with linked open data, big data, and AI in SMEs.

`5 Inclusive culture`, to ensure that culture is accessible and its specificities are developed for all. We would like develop *Listen Local Slovakia* in an intersectional approach to enable various minorities of the Slovak Republic to find or promote music that is relevant to their identity and culture.

`6 Respected culture` aims to increase the prestige of culture and creative industries and improve their recognition as an important value for society at the national level, to make their foreign presentation and international cooperation more effective. The way *Listen Local Slovakia* and the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database* is designed, it aims to syncronize accurate and real-time information about the Slovak current and heritage music repertoire in machine-to-machine communication via the internet of data. We think that this is an essential pre-requisite of music exports and finding new markets abroad.

`7 Responsible culture` to participate in identifying and addressing current environmental and other societal challenges, thereby increasing societal cohesion and resilience. The idea of *Listen Local* is to support the social sustainability elements of music, and re-build a positive impact with local communities, music and entertainment ecosystems.

### Fit with the Slovak Digitisation Agenda

![Digital Economy and Society Ranking 2022](png/DESI_2021_Europe.png)

According to the digitisation strategy,

> " Slovakia needs a business ecosystem that is capable of facing global competition and producing successful innovations. \[..\] Unification of rules in the EU can also lead to a significant increase of the competition that will bring about many challenges and opportunities. In general, it is possible to expect that companies, which want to succeed, need to innovate and digitalise their processes and, predominantly, offer services and products with high added value. Therefore, it is important for such companies to receive the following support:
>
> -   Support to test and create new business models,
>
> -   Support to introduce Ai solutions in business processes,
>
> -   Support in access to human capital, knowledge and technologies,
>
> -   And, last but not least, financial support during the entire innovation cycle from applied research up to innovations scaling."

And the latest assessment of the European Commission states that:

> "Overall, Slovakia's progress in the areas monitored is limited. Public funds spent so far to stimulate digital transformation have not always achieved the desired effect. There has been some progress in the integration of digital technology; for example, the percentage of enterprises using cloud computing services is steadily increasing. However, there continues to be a need for enterprises to utilise the potential of big data, AI and electronic information sharing systems." [@desi_slovakia_2022, p. 3.]
>
> Slovakia falls short of the EU average in the use of AI by enterprises (15% versus 25%) and in the use of cloud services (18% versus 26%). The share of enterprises that use big data analysis dropped from 9% to 6%. The country's ecommerce scores have partially improved: 17% of SMEs sell online which is at the EU average. [@desi_slovakia_2022, p. 12.]

We believe that with our Listen Local project we could be a laboratory of showing how one SME-based industry can cope with these challenges.

### Lessons for Statisticians

## Background Information

`1 A well-managed culture`, which aims to strengthen the performance of cultural policy based on quality management, participation and cooperation at all levels and to introduce a results-based evaluation approach.

`2 Efficiently funded culture` to systematically reduce infrastructure and modernisation backlog and increase the efficiency of the management and financing of culture and creative industries, to complement public sources of funding with private sources.

`3 A dignified culture`, which aims to improve the working and creative conditions for people working in the cultural and creative industries.

`4 Quality culture` to increase professionalism, innovation and quality in the cultural and creative industries.

`5 Inclusive culture`, to ensure that culture is accessible and its specificities are developed for all.

`6 Respected culture` aims to increase the prestige of culture and creative industries and improve their recognition as an important value for society at the national level, to make their foreign presentation and international cooperation more effective.

`7 Responsible culture` to participate in identifying and addressing current environmental and other societal challenges, thereby increasing societal cohesion and resilience.

### Triple transition

> "To set a course for the New Era scenario, Europe must simultaneously begin to overhaul the way it approaches climate issues, technology and the underlying shape of its society. This triple transition of green, digital and social factors will need to anchor policymaking at almost every level. Finance, education and institution building will all need to be mobilised, with a constant eye toward improving and sustaining trust in the European project." -- [@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 24.]

> There were severe job losses and furlough in the service sectors, including arts and culture, hotels and restaurants, sports, leisure, retail trade, transport and tourism-related industries, often more damaging to small and medium-size enterprises (European Commission, 2020d; International Labour Organization, 2021) [@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 96.]

To implement and monitor these triple transition policies, the EU has introduced the CSRD Directive (which must be transposed into Slovak national law by July 2023) and makes it mandatory for large companies to introduce integrated (connected) financial and ESG reporting. With the CSRD, the EU adds the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards to the existing financial accounting standards. The first not industry-specific drafts are already available, and the industry-specific ESRS that applies to the music, film, television, media and most creative industries will be developed in 2024/25.

While the CSRD Directive directly applies to the 49,000 large European Union companies, it is unlikely that any creative enterprise will be directly addressed in the Slovak Republic; the music industry and most creative industries will be indirectly affected. While the music businesses will not face a reporting requirement towards the public authorities, they can gain revenues (sales, sponsoring, donations and grants) only if they adhere to environmental, social and government reporting standards. In some ways, creative enterprises already feel the change when they must create Gender Equality Plans for various EU grant applications.

Participating in the triple transition is a critical strategic challenge for the music industry, which has chronically suffered from low access to private funds [@suvey_access_finance_culture_2013], and unless it prepares for sustainability measurement, will increase its difficulties for attracting both private and public funds that will be increasingly tied to ESG (environmental, social and governance) requirements. Making the creative and, more generally, service industries capable of accessing green finance (which will be the dominant form of financing in the EU) is the key to successful access to bank loans, investments, and participation in EU grant programs, for example, in the Creative Europe program.

We are working on measurement tools and a music economics research program that allows recording information more precisely on the music and creative sectors in a highly informal setting. We will talk about this in the next three, more practical sessions.

-   In Session 1 on building a voluntary and open statistical infrastructure that can connect to the official statistical infrastructure of the Slovak Republic.

-   In Session 2, we will discuss the necessity of connecting the economic, financial, environmental and social measurements on a public policy and an individual business level. For this reason, we suggest a more thorough survey harmonisation.

-   Session 3 will partly relate to the economic and social components of sustainability.

### Green transition

In this decade, a significant investment under the European Green Deal Program (financed mainly by the EU budget and the RFF), roughly 1 trillion euros, will be available to put the European economy on a path to net zero. The EU's sustainable finance policies made and continue making significant changes in banking, insurance, investment and accounting law to make brown financing more expensive and "green financing" cheaper because at least half of the green transition investments must be financed by the private sector. The EU encourages financing, insurance and investment in greening the economy by making it less attractive to invest into polluting technologies and industries. While reducing greenhouse gases remains the top priority, the green transition also entails more sustainable water, natural resources, land and marine ecosystem use. The green transition corresponds to several UN SDGs, namely, `SDG7` Affordable and clean energy, `SDG13` Climate Action, `SDG14` Life below water, `SDG15` Life on land.

While `Open Music Europe` is not focused on greening the music sector, the green transition is present in every strategic policy of the European Union and we indirectly deal with several data and measurement gaps that blocks the green transition and the access to finance in the music, and the wider creative industries.

### Digitisation

The main policy instrument of the European Union in terms of digitisation is the Digital Europe Programme [@eu_regulation_2021-694]; the relevant nationa policy for digitisation is the *2030 Digital Transformation Strategy for Slovakia* [@2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_en_2019; @2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_sk_2019]. The latest assessment of the European Commission places the country in the lower tier of the EU countries in terms of this policy. The EU Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) summarises digital performance and tracks progress of EU countries since 2014. Our key countries are all, i.e., Hungary (22), Slovakia (23) and Bulgaria (26) are in the lower tier of the EU.

According to the Slovak country report [@desi_slovakia_2022], "\[d\]igital transformation is one of the main components of the Slovak RRP. Component 17 - 'Digital Slovakia (state in the mobile, cybersecurity, fast internet for everyone, digital economy') clearly stands out as the main contributor to achieving the digital target, followed by digital investments in education, research & innovation, and sustainable transport. \[...\] Slovakia ranks 21st in the EU on integration of digital technology by enterprises."

The music industry---like most creative industries---is an almost fully digitised industry, even though the Slovak digitisation strategy not only does not recognize the cultural and creative industries among its priority areas, but has no words for either creators or culture. Nevertheless, we believe that the music industry can serve as laboratory to measure the half-way progress in this strategy, and to cope with the employment, tax, economic and education policy challenges it is posing with innovative measurement. In music, the recorded side of the business would be excluded from sophisticated global platforms like YouTube or Spotify if it could not operate in such an environment. International festivals also do business in a highly digitised manner. In this regard, the music industry can be a laboratory of evidence-based policies. Digitisation provides a constant measurement problem. Measuring work or income on and from platforms is challenging, and the tools need further development to measure the informal economy. Many of the problems we deal with (we'll get back to this in Session 3---Listen Local) is that even though Slovak creatives and their enterprises are forerunners in digitisation, their lack of skills results in significant loss of revenue and market position.

### Social transition

While the direct health and mortality effects were more severe for older adults, the economic impacts were more profound for younger workers and the lower educated (Dowd et al., 2020b). Graph 21 shows the disproportionate impact on employment for youth (Graph 21a), the lower-skilled (Graph 21b), women (Graph 21c) and those in temporary contracts and self-employed (Graph 21d).

> COVID-19 was linked to a proliferation of new forms of employment, which \> blur formal employer-employee relations, transform working patterns and times, \> organisation, the location of work and the use of ICT. \[...\] New forms of employment include multiple types of arrangements, including platform work where supply and demand is matched on online platforms where workers using the apps are mostly freelancers. The pandemic brought some increase in platform workers, with demand for delivery services growing during the lockdown and many platforms expanding their scope. \[...\] There has also been a growth in portfolio work of freelancers or small self-employed workers with a large number of clients. As of 2020, ICT-based mobile work, platform work and solo self-employed workers and freelancers and co-working in collaborative employment were prevalent across Europe (Eurofound, 2020b). Collaborative employment refers to self- employed people working beyond traditional supply chains and involves cooperation and networking. [@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 101-103.]

> Different types of work forms during COVID-19 raise questions about the employment status of these different types of workers and often their lack of employment protection. This includes a lack of clarity on working conditions, notice periods, vacation or sick pay, minimum wage, health and safety standards, as well as on organised representation or protection. Non-standard and unfavourable working times or long or sporadic hours can in turn limit workers' flexibility and autonomy. Other drawbacks are lack of transparency for platform workers on algorithm automating tasks or unpaid work while waiting for bids or tasks.[@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 106.]

Social sustainability is often grouped into four areas: - Quality of life - Social Cohesion - Democracy & Governance - Diversity and Equality

Our work program is targeting Diversity and Equal Opportunities, which have an impact on Social Cohesion and intersect with governance, for example, via equal opportunities for career and in representation on governance boards for women.

We believe that Diversity is the most relevant for cultural policy and the cultural and creative industry policies, because cultural diversity is primary goal of the sectorial policies.

Policy indicators

Sustainability indicators:

The ESRS Social Sustainability and Governance standards all include diversity aspects. For example, equal opportunities for women must secured (and measured) in the own workforce, in the value chain, in the affected communities and among end-users, too.

In the European music industry, there is a vocal demand for respecting diversity in gender and sexual appearance terms. In Slovakia, and in many countries of Europe, the dimension of national origin also plays an important role, and these will be important pillars of our Slovak Comprehensive Music Database that feeds into our Listen Local initiative. We want to ensure that the people of Kosice or the people of Slovakia get equal access to
