## Policy Agenda Introduction

After the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers in Europe increasingly discuss the strategic public policy agenda under the 'triple transition' term, which refers to approaches in climate issues ("green transition"), technology ("digital transition") and the underlying shape of its society ("social transition"). We will use this terminology because it is highly relevant to our work. Since the " triple transition" is a top-level and horizontal policy framework, we can also discuss the Slovak cultural strategy (together with other Slovak policies, such as the digitisation strategy) in a shared framework with the EU policies. We can easily adjust the Slovak policy document's contents under these terms.

The "triple transition" is highly relevant to our work because these horizontal policies guide public investment, have new rules on private investment spending, and foresee changes in economic and tax policies. The EU's cultural programme Creative Europe already follows the triple transition framework, and it is relatively easy to imagine the Slovak cultural strategy 2030 in this framework, too, or to map our Open Music Europe research program and its work packages and work tasks in this format.

We reviewed three Slovak policy documents for our work which are relevant: the sectorial _Stratégia kultúry a kreatívneho priemyslu Slovenskej republiky 2030_ (henceforth: **Slovak CCI Strategy**), the _Slovakia’s Vision and Development Strategy 2030 - a long-term strategy for sustainable development_ [@slovak_sdg_strategy_2020]---henceforth: **Slovak Strategic SDGs**, which has significant cultural elements, and the _2030 Digital Transformation Strategy for Slovakia_ [@2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_en_2019; @2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_sk_2019]--henceforth: **Slovak Digitisation Strategy**, which is highly relevant for the innovation we are doing in Slovakia under the label “Listen Local” in WP2.3.  These documents were made in different years, and they are consistent with the EU policy document of that given year; they show little cross-referencing however within the Slovak documents.  This means that for example, the most dated Slovak Digitisation Strategy is having no reference to the cultural and creative industries at all, but also, the later  _Slovak CCI Strategy_ has very little concrete reference to the SDG policies and no reference to the Slovak Digitisation Strategy. The  _Slovak CCI Strategy_ is a well-designed policy paper, and it is easy to link to the relevant, horizontal SGD and digitisation policies.

The “triple transition” is highly relevant to our work because these horizontal policies guide public investment, have new rules on private investment spending, and foresee changes in economic and tax policies. It immediately connects with the 2nd strategic priority of the  _Slovak CCI Strategy_, **2 Efficiently funded culture** to systematically reduce the infrastructure and modernisation gap, increase the efficiency of the finance management and financing of culture and creative industries, and complement public funding sources with private sources.


The following KPIs of this strategic objective are very relevant to our work.

- KPI `2e` Reduction of investment gap in the culture sector compared to investment needs at baseline, which foresees a 640-million-euro excess investment till 2030.

- KPI `2a` Share of value added of culture and creative industries in the value added of the economy, which is projected to grow at a higher rate than the Slovak economy.

- KPIs `2c`, `2d` Share of own revenues, which are expected to grow.

In line with the policy objective of the _Slovak CCI Strategy_, the reduction of the investment gap and a subsequent structural reform that increases revenues and value-added require additional funding outside of the Slovak public treasury. To meet the target value of the outcome indicators, good investments must be made, preferably financed from the EU budget or Recovery and Resilience Facility (RFF) funds or private sources. Since investments take time to increase revenues and value-added, the time is now to participate in the triple transition.

![Schema of the European Growth Model](jpg/comnat_COM_2022_0083_FIN.ENG.xhtml.COM_2022_0083_FIN_ENG_02002.jpg){fig-align="center"}

The triple transition is an excellent opportunity for the CCSIs, particularly the music industry, to become more competitive, sustainable and resilient. They can more easily meet the requirements for sustainable financing than most industries and turn their previous disadvantage in attracting financing into an advantage. On the public policy level, if we can help the Slovak CCSIs meet the requirements for these massive investments, the Slovak cultural policy can mobilise apart from the limited national public budgets, significant EU public investment and private investment. This way, the means of the current Slovak cultural strategy can be increased.

Many horizontal EU measures, ranging from the sustainable finance package to competition and consumer protection rules aim to make more sustainable investments and operations more profitable, and make less sustainable or brown activities less profitable. The Creative Europe program or the RFF facility are already programmed under the triple transition agenda. As a consequence, `Open Music Europe` wants to bring sustainability out of its silo and mainstream it into its music economics research and policy recommendations. 

### Green Transition, Effective Funding, Dignified Culture

The EU **green transition** policy and the _European Green Deal_ offers huge investments into restructuring the current service model and supply chain more sustainably. This is one area where the _Slovak Strategic SDGs_ and the _Slovak CCI Strategy_ should be jointly followed, but not only with a "green eye". 

We do not only connect the _green transition_ with the _Slovak CCI Strategy_ objective `7 Responsible culture`, but also with `2 Effectively funded culture` and `3 A dignified culture`. In line with our own assessment, we believe that CCSIs, and the music industry are no different, creating value in a highly labour-intensive way. They use mainly human input and intellectual property as intangible capital and use less tangible capital than the typical Slovak economic sector. Whether we want to increase the _gross value added_ or the _gross domestic product_, the CCSIs will likely increase the value-added or domestic product via the income generated by their labour, intellectual property and capital investments. Furthermore, because of the sector's high level of informality and fragmentation, persona and mixed-income will contribute more to the value-added and domestic product than corporate income.

Consequently, indicators to help develop and control strategic objective 2 will only work with the employment-focused objective 3. Our _Economy of music in Europe: Novel data collection methods and indicators_ [@antal_et_al_2023] places a huge emphasis on employment and personal income because we believe that it is not only a desirable strategic objective to increase their values, but they are essential to meet the more general funding and value-added targets, too.

Perhaps a bit surprisingly, we place now the following KPIs under the _green transition_ agenda, because we believe that the necessary structural reforms in that area go hand-in-hand with these objectives, strictly in a creative economics point of view. Until 2030 in Europe the most likely financing source to meet the following KPIs is public and private sustainable finance.

- KPI `3a` Share of employment in culture and creative industries in the
total economy
- KPI `3b`Number of male and female employees in the cultural and
creative industry
Number of self-employed persons in the culture and creative
industries
- KPI `3d` Average income in culture and creative industries; number of
industries lagging behind the national economy average value.
- KPI `3e` Average wages of professional men and women in the cultural and creative industries as a proportion of the national average wage of university-educated men and women in the national economy

The KPIs that were reviewed so far show a critical missing link in the strategy document and its successful implementation. The KPIs the ministry uses are based on a satellite account, which has a macroeconomic view that none of the cultural sector institutions or creative businesses can relate to directly. The current Slovak satellite accounts do not produce indicators for the music industry, audiovisual industry, film industry, or architecture. However, raising the investment or employment/income component of the GDP requires very different actions in the music industry and architecture, for example.   There are no common institutions, and there are no cross-cutting enterprises that are present in both music and architecture. For a practical translation of the outcome indicators into actionable and measurable steps, we need indicators for the music industry, the film industry, and architecture, just as banking, insurance, or car manufacturing have them.

When discussing our novel approaches to closing the data gaps of the music economy, we are not reinventing the wheel. Our first recommendation is that we need those top-line indicators for the music industry that would come on the top of the head of any policymaker, like share in the GDP or total male and female employment or average wage. We will also suggest a few industry-specific indicators, but mainly not connected to the economy.

Having such indicators is not self-explanatory or easy. Most EU countries still need a cultural satellite account like Slovakia has, and even though Slovakia invested in this tool, it still needs to produce indicators for the music or film industry. However, these indicators could help successful RFF or Creative Europe applications from the music or film industry, which would be required to make successful loans or investment proposals towards private funds. They would be required to make good investments that increase productivity and can lift personal incomes, too.

Our proposals related to the `WP1 Music Economy Pillar` of `Open Music Europe` offer more data management, estimation, and fusion innovations than inventions of new fancy indicators. We suggest a novel public-private partnership that can connect open government data with open science data and invest in a more actionable, usable satellite account system that includes the music industry. We believe that our efforts can be replicated with very little or no cost to other copyright-based industries or often to other service industries, too; in this regard, the music industry can play the role of laboratory to implement data and measurements innovations in the broad CCSI or even the service sectors. These suggestions will be the topic of Session 1.


Strategic Priority `7.2` Support the creation, production, dissemination and visibility of sustainable products and projects in the cultural and creative industries should be more emphasised, and we should develop its own indicators (as there is no real KPI addressing this priority.)








-   On the level of regulation and technical assistance, we must ensure that the Slovak CCSIs meet the requirements for sustainable financing, particularly the reporting and disclosure rules of the CSRD directive, and we will be developing tools for this in WP3 and WP4 of Open Music Europe. We will be the topic of Session 2.

-   On the level of CCSI public policy and music economics, we need to be able to locate, record, and analyse data about how the value chain works, i.e., where and how much value added is created. These problems relate to our WP1 and WP4 and will be the topic of Session 1.

-   As a result, we hope to see increased personal, company and tax income and increased productivity and competitiveness of the Slovak music industry. This work is almost fully transferable to other CCSIs, particularly copyright-based industries such as film or media.

Measuring elements of social sustainability intersect with the economic/labour policy goals of reducing informality at work and increasing the visibility of Slovak culture abroad at home. We will discuss these topics in Session 2 and 3.

### Social Transition

The **social transition** entails many things, and in `Open Music Europe`, we chose a few of them which are particularly important for the music industry. The problem of informality, or the prevalence of informal working relations and informal enterprises in music, is relevant for the music economy and its social sustainability because working conditions, social protection and anti-discrimination measures are far more difficult or impossible to monitor and enforce in the informal economy.

Under the `WP3 Sustainability pillar`, we want to pilot survey-based indicators that fulfil the requirements set by draft ESRS, the currently drafted European Sustainability Reporting Standards. Like in the case of the economy, most of our innovation is going beyond finding new indicators but finding ways to produce them at scale and a reasonable cost. This requires survey harmonisation and, again, innovation in data production. While ESRS involves the invention of new indicators, the most critical indicators are defined by the standard itself, yet they had never been measured in the Slovak CCSIs.

Regarding KPIs, the _Slovak CCSI Strategy_ in some cases requires separate indicators for women and men, and also involves some objectives for national minorities, and for people with different sexual appearance or with a migration background. Providing impact assessment for these groups is also mandatory under ESRS for the own workforce, for suppliers and affected communities, and they should be creatively harmonized with Cultural Access and Participation surveying and mixed-mode labour force surveying. 

Survey harmonisation is essential to meet the social sustainability measurement challenges, but it is also necessary for measuring demand in our Music economy pillar.  Our project and its background in the CEEMID project have the most to offer to the policymakers in this field.  The  _Slovak CCI Strategy_ document is based on a single Cultural Access and Participation survey, while our project partners have conducted more detailed CAP surveys in Slovakia in 2015 and 2020.  Also, we have developed ways to retrospectively harmonise CAP survey blocks from other EU surveys, such as Eurobarometer, AES and EU-SILC.  Unlike most strategic objectives, strategic objective `6 Respected culture` fully and `7 xxx` partly rely on the current CAP surveying that the Slovak statistical system currently cannot offer.  Our project can provide new measurements and retrospective harmonisation for existing measures going back at least 20 years for the following KPIs.

- `KPI 6a` Active cultural participation of the population/interested artistic activity, reference value from 2015 is 9,3 %. We can offer further history to this KPI, not only artistic activity, but separately for various artisitc activities, such as playing a music instrument, singing or acting.
- `KPI 6b` Passive cultural participation of the population 59 % (2015); again, we can offer further historic data and new measurements. 
- `KPI 6c` Public perception of the importance of culture---we have some historic data and we can pilot better measurement.
- `KPI 6d` Attendance at public collections  3 086 980 (2020); we can offer more historic data and also methodological advise how to better measure this KPI.
- `KPI 6e` Percentage of citizens with a library card 5,94 % (2020) 17,80 %---we have related data for many years, and we believe that this KPI could be better measured with standardised EU indicators.
- `KPI 6f` Attendance at performing arts institutions 590 559 (2020)---we could make a case study of the measurement problems and show data not only for music, but various forms of arts.
- `KPI 6g` Attendance at festivals (theatre, music, film festivals, shows, non professional culture competitions, etc.) 367 923 (2020)---we have ample experience in this field and we could further develop the questionnaire here, because festival- and non-festival like performances are often overlapping.
- `KPI 6h` Aggregate attendance at cultural institutions 7 799 806 (2021)---we have experience and data to improve this estimate and break it down to cultural sectors.
- `KPI 7c` Percentage of citizens who trust the media---we can provide a long historical data series for this and we can include it in our measurement.
- `KPI 7d` Percentage of the population that has no reservations about a
neighbour from another culture---we can provide a long historical data series for this and we can include it in our measurement.
- `KPI 7g` Percentage of the population who agree that other people can be---this relates to our earlier experiments (not yet published, low hanging fruit), where we can provide data, generally about the usefulness of moving from a strictly socio-demographic model of CAP surveying to a partly psychometric model. 

_We have experimented with an extended sociology-demography that includes trust and psychometric trait variables, and we can show that, for example, the differences in cultural participation often attributed to gender are caused by specific psychometric properties to be more prevalent among female respondents_.


### Digital Transition, Quality Culture, Dignified Culture

The **digital transition** is a crucial European and Slovak policy which so far has been isolated on the Slovak level from the cultural strategy. The official digitisation strategy of Slovakia does not say a single word about the CCSIs and has no cultural or creative industry-specific priorities or actions.

In the post-Covid economy, often named the "platform economy", the informal work typical in music for at least ten years (since we measure it) appeared outside the cultural sector in many parts of the Slovak economy. Our measurement innovations and proposals are relevant far beyond the scope of the music industry or CCSIs; the music industry can be a laboratory for highly relevant labour or tax policy work. Dealing with the problem of informality is very important for the green/economic and social transition, too, and essential to the challenges of digitisation. 

The main policy of the digital transition on the level of the EU is the  _Digital Europe Programme_[@eu_regulation_2021-694], which also takes up the second largest chunk of the EU and RFF budget after the green transition. The KPIs of this policy are measured in country reports by the European Commission. The country report on Slovakia and its Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) does not paint a rosy picture [@desi_slovakia_2022]. Slovakia as a country is among the lowest performers in digitisation, which critically threatens the competitiveness of the economy and meeting the Slovak strategic SDG goals. 

Out of the three reviewed Slovak national policies, the most dated one is the _Slovak Digitalisation Strategy_, written in a very optimistic tone in 2019. At the time, the predecessor of our project started the Listen Local Slovakia demonstration project and created our _Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia & Abroad_ [@antal_promoting_slovak_2020; @antal_promoting_slovak_2020-SK]. This music-industry-specific study and demonstration can be seen as an industry-specific experiment meeting the real-life challenges of the digitisation strategy, particularly the digitisation challenges of SMEs. 
As opposed to the optimistic tone of the _Slovak Digitalisation Strategy_, we had shown that digitisation did not increase; on the contrary, it may have even decreased the competitiveness of the Slovak music industry. Slovak music businesses and individual creators met the digitisation challenges of SMEs earlier than most of the Slovak economy because they had to move their retail sales to global platforms, such as YouTube, Spotify, or Apple, before 2019. On these platforms, sales are almost entirely robotised and driven by AI algorithms. 

As we have shown in 2020, moving to global platforms increased the competition and has driven down prices. At the same time, enormous data skills were needed to collect micropayments. As a result, we showed in 2020 that about 17% of the Slovak repertoire present on global platforms could not even be found due to data problems, and at least 50% of the creators and their businesses missed payments due to data/metadata problems. 

One of the primary motivations for bringing `Open Music Europe` together was that we could not find national funding to continue this critical work that has been used far beyond the music industry; we believe that it could be a testing laboratory for all copyright-based CCSIs, and to many other service industries. Global platforms are in the hands of the world's most giant corporations, which employ an army of data engineers and scientists.  On the other hand, to work with them as equal and not exploited partners, it is not reasonable to expect that every Slovak SME or music business can hire their own data engineer or data scientist. Our main idea with the creation of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database and Listen Local, and in a broader sense, with the Slovak Music Industry Register, is to initiate national data public-private partnerships and support the Slovak SMEs with data and data know-how to meet collectively the challenges of the digital economy.

Apart from the contribution to the earlier mentioned goals to an effectively funded and a dignified culture (which collects a larger share of own revenues and able to finance its sustainable growth) this project element can also contribute to the hard-to measure indicators in strategic objective `4 Quality culture` and `5 Inclusive culture`.  

-  `KPI 4g` Share of culture and creative industries exports in total exports.
-  `KPI 4e`  Number of works or authors who have been successful in
international competitions (cultural heritage, literature, audiovisual
and design)
-  `KPI 5d` Share of broadcasting for national minorities in public service media---this should be made together with measuring Slovak shares in local public and private broadcast media and streaming ('radio quotas') and in export markets, too; the situation of Slovak music abroad, and often even at home is rather similar to the national minorities, because the majority of music used in commercial media is foreigh.

-   The creative industry, particularly the music industry, is far more digitised than the rest of the Slovak economy, according to the latest DESI assessment. Since the main sales configuration of music is music- and video streaming on global platforms, the Slovak music industry had to cope with far more accelerated digitisation than the rest of the economy.

-   The creation of the planned Slovak Comprehensive Music Database, the Slovak Music Industry Register, and our Listen Local program offer a way to simultaneously deal with significant cultural and digitisation policy challenges. We want to redesign the local content policies (i.e., radio quotas) for broadcasters to global streaming platforms to ensure a visible presence for Slovak music both within Slovakia and abroad.

## Session 1 Data infrastructure (Daniel Antal, CFA) {#session1}

-   Overview of the Open Policy Analysis
-   Overview of our planned Data infrastructure (the DMP must be public!)
-   Slovak Music Industry Register (see [here](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/economy/report/report.html#music-industry-registers))
-   Comprehensive Slovak Music Industry Database (in technical terms)
-   The indicator candidates must be changed before we go into the discussion, because this part is misleading. These are not indicator candidates, but pre-existing indicators. The pre-existing indicators should be better documented (i.e. what is their data sources, and how they are calculated from the data), and our proposals should be added here.

## Background Information

> "To set a course for the New Era scenario, Europe must simultaneously begin to overhaul the way it approaches climate issues, technology and the underlying shape of its society. This triple transition of green, digital and social factors will need to anchor policymaking at almost every level. Finance, education and institution building will all need to be mobilised, with a constant eye toward improving and sustaining trust in the European project." -- [@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 24.]

> There were severe job losses and furlough in the service sectors, including arts and culture, hotels and restaurants, sports, leisure, retail trade, transport and tourism-related industries, often more damaging to small and medium-size enterprises (European Commission, 2020d; International Labour Organization, 2021) [@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 96.]

To implement and monitor these triple transition policies, the EU has introduced the CSRD Directive (which must be transposed into Slovak national law by July 2023) and makes it mandatory for large companies to introduce integrated (connected) financial and ESG reporting. With the CSRD, the EU adds the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards to the existing financial accounting standards. The first not industry-specific drafts are already available, and the industry-specific ESRS that applies to the music, film, television, media and most creative industries will be developed in 2024/25.

While the CSRD Directive directly applies to the 49,000 large European Union companies, it is unlikely that any creative enterprise will be directly addressed in the Slovak Republic; the music industry and most creative industries will be indirectly affected. While the music businesses will not face a reporting requirement towards the public authorities, they can gain revenues (sales, sponsoring, donations and grants) only if they adhere to environmental, social and government reporting standards. In some ways, creative enterprises already feel the change when they must create Gender Equality Plans for various EU grant applications.

Participating in the triple transition is a critical strategic challenge for the music industry, which has chronically suffered from low access to private funds [@suvey_access_finance_culture_2013], and unless it prepares for sustainability measurement, will increase its difficulties for attracting both private and public funds that will be increasingly tied to ESG (environmental, social and governance) requirements. Making the creative and, more generally, service industries capable of accessing green finance (which will be the dominant form of financing in the EU) is the key to successful access to bank loans, investments, and participation in EU grant programs, for example, in the Creative Europe program.

We are working on measurement tools and a music economics research program that allows recording information more precisely on the music and creative sectors in a highly informal setting. We will talk about this in the next three, more practical sessions.

-   In Session 1 on building a voluntary and open statistical infrastructure that can connect to the official statistical infrastructure of the Slovak Republic.

-   In Session 2, we will discuss the necessity of connecting the economic, financial, environmental and social measurements on a public policy and an individual business level. For this reason, we suggest a more thorough survey harmonisation.

-   Session 3 will partly relate to the economic and social components of sustainability.

### Green transition

In this decade, a significant investment under the European Green Deal Program (financed mainly by the EU budget and the RFF), roughly 1 trillion euros, will be available to put the European economy on a path to net zero. The EU's sustainable finance policies made and continue making significant changes in banking, insurance, investment and accounting law to make brown financing more expensive and "green financing" cheaper because at least half of the green transition investments must be financed by the private sector. The EU encourages financing, insurance and investment in greening the economy by making it less attractive to invest into polluting technologies and industries. While reducing greenhouse gases remains the top priority, the green transition also entails more sustainable water, natural resources, land and marine ecosystem use. The green transition corresponds to several UN SDGs, namely, `SDG7` Affordable and clean energy, `SDG13` Climate Action, `SDG14` Life below water, `SDG15` Life on land.

While `Open Music Europe` is not focused on greening the music sector, the green transition is present in every strategic policy of the European Union and we indirectly deal with several data and measurement gaps that blocks the green transition and the access to finance in the music, and the wider creative industries.

### Digitisation

The main policy instrument of the European Union in terms of digitisation is the Digital Europe Programme [@eu_regulation_2021-694]; the relevant nationa policy for digitisation is the *2030 Digital Transformation Strategy for Slovakia* [@2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_en_2019; @2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_sk_2019]. The latest assessment of the European Commission places the country in the lower tier of the EU countries in terms of this policy. The EU Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) summarises digital performance and tracks progress of EU countries since 2014. Our key countries are all, i.e., Hungary (22), Slovakia (23) and Bulgaria (26) are in the lower tier of the EU.

According to the Slovak country report [@desi_slovakia_2022], "\[d\]igital transformation is one of the main components of the Slovak RRP. Component 17 - 'Digital Slovakia (state in the mobile, cybersecurity, fast internet for everyone, digital economy') clearly stands out as the main contributor to achieving the digital target, followed by digital investments in education, research & innovation, and sustainable transport. \[...\] Slovakia ranks 21st in the EU on integration of digital technology by enterprises."

The music industry---like most creative industries---is an almost fully digitised industry, even though the Slovak digitisation strategy not only does not recognize the cultural and creative industries among its priority areas, but has no words for either creators or culture. Nevertheless, we believe that the music industry can serve as laboratory to measure the half-way progress in this strategy, and to cope with the employment, tax, economic and education policy challenges it is posing with innovative measurement. In music, the recorded side of the business would be excluded from sophisticated global platforms like YouTube or Spotify if it could not operate in such an environment. International festivals also do business in a highly digitised manner. In this regard, the music industry can be a laboratory of evidence-based policies. Digitisation provides a constant measurement problem. Measuring work or income on and from platforms is challenging, and the tools need further development to measure the informal economy. Many of the problems we deal with (we'll get back to this in Session 3---Listen Local) is that even though Slovak creatives and their enterprises are forerunners in digitisation, their lack of skills results in significant loss of revenue and market position.

### Social transition

While the direct health and mortality effects were more severe for older adults, the economic impacts were more profound for younger workers and the lower educated (Dowd et al., 2020b). Graph 21 shows the disproportionate impact on employment for youth (Graph 21a), the lower-skilled (Graph 21b), women (Graph 21c) and those in temporary contracts and self-employed (Graph 21d).

> COVID-19 was linked to a proliferation of new forms of employment, which \> blur formal employer-employee relations, transform working patterns and times, \> organisation, the location of work and the use of ICT. \[...\] New forms of employment include multiple types of arrangements, including platform work where supply and demand is matched on online platforms where workers using the apps are mostly freelancers. The pandemic brought some increase in platform workers, with demand for delivery services growing during the lockdown and many platforms expanding their scope. \[...\] There has also been a growth in portfolio work of freelancers or small self-employed workers with a large number of clients. As of 2020, ICT-based mobile work, platform work and solo self-employed workers and freelancers and co-working in collaborative employment were prevalent across Europe (Eurofound, 2020b). Collaborative employment refers to self- employed people working beyond traditional supply chains and involves cooperation and networking. [@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 101-103.]

> Different types of work forms during COVID-19 raise questions about the employment status of these different types of workers and often their lack of employment protection. This includes a lack of clarity on working conditions, notice periods, vacation or sick pay, minimum wage, health and safety standards, as well as on organised representation or protection. Non-standard and unfavourable working times or long or sporadic hours can in turn limit workers' flexibility and autonomy. Other drawbacks are lack of transparency for platform workers on algorithm automating tasks or unpaid work while waiting for bids or tasks.[@european_commission_new_era_2022, p. 106.]

Social sustainability is often grouped into four areas: - Quality of life - Social Cohesion - Democracy & Governance - Diversity and Equality

Our work program is targeting Diversity and Equal Opportunities, which have an impact on Social Cohesion and intersect with governance, for example, via equal opportunities for career and in representation on governance boards for women.

We believe that Diversity is the most relevant for cultural policy and the cultural and creative industry policies, because cultural diversity is primary goal of the sectorial policies.

Policy indicators

Sustainability indicators:

The ESRS Social Sustainability and Governance standards all include diversity aspects. For example, equal opportunities for women must secured (and measured) in the own workforce, in the value chain, in the affected communities and among end-users, too.

In the European music industry, there is a vocal demand for respecting diversity in gender and sexual appearance terms. In Slovakia, and in many countries of Europe, the dimension of national origin also plays an important role, and these will be important pillars of our Slovak Comprehensive Music Database that feeds into our Listen Local initiative. We want to ensure that the people of Kosice or the people of Slovakia get equal access to
