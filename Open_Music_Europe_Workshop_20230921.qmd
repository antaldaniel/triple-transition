## Triple transition

-   Towards a green, digital and resilient economy: our European Growth Model [@commission_towards_green_digital_resilient_2022]

-   A new era for Europe: how the European Union can make the most of its pandemic recovery, pursue sustainable growth, and promote global stability. Strategic policy document by the High-Level Group on Post-Covid Economic and Social Challenges [@european_commission_new_era_2022]

-   Slovakia's Vision and Development Strategy 2030 - a long-term strategy for sustainable development [@slovak_sdg_strategy_2020], has significant cultural component with indicators.

## Triple Transition Framework

Since the "triple transition" is a top-level and horizontal 🇪🇺 policy   framework, we can also discuss the 🇸🇰 cultural strategy (together with other horizontal policies, such as the sustainable development and  digitisation strategy) in a shared framework with the EU policies.

## Green transition

The green transition as an opportunity to finance reforms and structural reform, including a competitive reconfiguration of the music industry supply chain.

- `🇸🇰 Dignified culture`: measure and reduce informality, value added and its components (personal, mixed, corporate income and tax base) for a sustainable and resilient reform.

- `🇸🇰 Well-funded culture`: The European Green Deal and connecting private sources offer +Є1 trillion---CCSI well-placed for above-average share.

- `🇸🇰 Responsible culture`: ESG reporting/sustainable finance compliance of the sector; avoid lock-out from global supply chains by ESG compliance.

- `♯ Music economy pillar:` Bring measurement of value added in the value chain to the level of other industries by improving the current satellite accounts.

## Green transition: policy fit

The green transition framework offers policy reconciliation with the Slovak cultural and SDG strategy. 

- indicator candidates from SK Culture
- indicator candidates from SK SDG
- our indicator candidates.

## Social transition

- Diversity as an important pillar of social sustainability, good corporate governance, and cultural policy goals (such as radio quotas).

- `🇸🇰 Inclusive culture`: The music industry remains inclusive: diversity of the own workforce of music.

- `🇸🇰 Responsible culture`: Music and the CCI have data collection plans, indicators, tools to meet CSRD/ESRS standards. Diversity in affected communities (education, local ecosystems, audience.)

- `🇸🇰 Respected culture`: we want to ensure that Slovak music is visible, which is also an economic aim (music earns money based on visibility.)

- `♯ Music economy pillar + social sustainability:` Informality has both economic and social aspects, because it is very difficult to ensure that social rights are respected and discrimination is avoided in the informal economy.

## Social transition: policy fit

`Open Music Europe` focuses on the diversity aspects of social sustainability, but our music economy work directly relates to social secturity.

- indicator candidates from SK Culture
- indicator candidates from SK SDG
- our indicator candidates.

## Digital transformation

- `🇪🇺  Digital Europe`: does not include CCSI at all, even though according to the DESI 2022 the Slovak economy, and particularly SMEs are far behind in digitisation compared to the music industry. [@eu_regulation_2021-694]

- `🇸🇰  2030 Digital Transformation Strategy`: The creative industry, particularly the music industry, is far more digitised than the rest of the Slovak economy, according to the latest DESI assessment. The music industry could be a policy lab to meet the challenges of the Slovak policy. [@desi_slovakia_2022;  @2030_digital_transformation_slovakia_en_2019]

- `♯ Listen Local` Addressing the issues on competitiveness, income, visibility in the era of big data and AI. Building the Slovak Comprehensive Music Industry Database, providing collaborative solutions for SMEs without data engineering/science skills.

## Digital transformation: policy fit

- indicator candidates from SK Culture + SK Digitisation
- indicator candidates from SK SDG
- our indicator candidates.

# Session 1 Harmonizing open data and government data programs

## Data infrastructure

- `♯ Open Policy Analysis Guidelines + FAIR = Data PPP`: Create a complementing (open, voluntary) statistical program besides the Slovak national data program.

- `♯ Slovak Music Industry Register`: enable the satellite accounts to produce indicators for the music industry (and later other industries), necessary for filtering administrative data sources as well as survey microdata. 

- `♯ Survey harmonisation`: Harmonisation of KULT with European standard surveys, potential harmonisation of LFS, AES, etc with our industry surveys ➡️ Session 2, survey harmonisation in more detail.

- `♯ Slovak Comprehensive Music Database`: enable the monitoring of Slovak radio quotas and other cultural policies ➡️ Listen Local, Session 3 in more detail. 

## Data infrastructure: potential case studies, small projects

- `🇸🇰 statistical data program + ♯ Open Music Europe Data Management Plan`: could be a best practice in open data and open science. 1. Conceptual publication. 2. Use case with actual data collected in 2024/2025. See: [OPA Repository on Data Management](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/open-music-europe-data-management-plan)

- `🇸🇰 satellite accounts upgraded with ♯ Music industry`: 1. Conceptual publication. 2. Creation of music industry variables. 3. SIOT analysis, economic, social, environmental impact assessments, policy scenarios. See: [OPA Repository on novel data collection methods and indicators for the music economy](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/report-european-music-economy)

## Indicator candidates (general)

- `Bring music industry to the level of other sectors`: The Slovak statistical system, including the satellite accounts, do not offer actionable indicators for the music industry, and we aim to create at least top-line indicators (GDP and its various income components, employment.)

- `Industry-specific indicators`: Offer indicators make the work of the industry as a whole, and its institutions and organisations work better. Re-use open government data and add own collection.


## Indicator candidates: levelling the music industry

- `GVA`, `GDP`, `income components`: Attempt to build up GDP with the help of the `Slovak Music Industry Register`.

- [select some indicators from SK culture]

- [select some indicators from SK SDG]

## Indicator candidates: music-industry specific

- `Local Content Regulation`: Tools to measure the market share and use share of the Slovak repertoire in radio, and attempt to estimate in streaming, TV or other uses with the help of the `Slovak Comprehensive Music Database`.

- [select some indicators indspired from SK culture]

- ESG measurement following CSRD/ESRS focusing on climate change, diversity, limited aspects of governance.

# Session 2 Survey harmonization

## Working with Roč 2-01

Harmonisation with the small enterprises questionnaire Roč 2-01 is perhaps our most immediate goal. This is a low-hangign fruit because we need to harmonise the way the data is collected, not what is collected.

- Ensure that the `Slovak Music Industry Register` allows to filter microdata from relevant enterprises.
- Ensure on a voluntary basis that additional enterprises fill out the survey from the music industry to allow the creation of music industry indicators.

## CAP harmonisation

CAP surveys are perhaps the most important data sources for the indicators in the SK Culture Strategy, nevertheless, only one survey has been used for the policy setting.

- Offer the secondary analysis of all CAP surveys conducted in Slovakia since 2004.

- Use the `Open Music Europe` CAP survey to develop indicators that cannot be calculated from pre-existing CAPs in Eurobarometer, AES and LFS, and conducted by SOZA and the industry.

## Potential harmonisation of KULT

???

## Potential harmonisation with LFS

Harmonization with LFS would mainly require filtering and protocol data harmonisation.  

- LFS is a costly and highly standardised survey, and it is unlikely that the main question blocks can be substantially alterred.

- The `Slovak Music Industry Register` and potentially the `Slovak Music Industry Database` could allow the filtering of music industry related data.

- A protocol extension would be required to fill up musician quota on a voluntary basis (it is not likely that LFS has a large-enough musician subsample.)

- The protocol extension requires additional protocol questions on questionnaire to identify 'musician', 'filmmaker', or 'architect'  respondants. The current classifications are not useful for the creative industries.

## Mixed survey methodology improvements

The music industry itself could be a laboratory to improve mixed surveying because of the very small average enterprise size, and the high level of informality, which makes the mixed use of personal and enterprise surveys.

# Session 3 Listen Local Slovakia

## Listen Local Slovakia

- `♯ Listen Local Feasibility Study and Demo`: In 2020 we had shown how local content policies could be implemented in the streaming platform, and how we could support a better digitisation of the sector. We created the `Slovak Demo Music Database`.

-  `🇸🇰 Slovak Comprehensive Music Database`: A Linked Open Data resource that supports rights management, music export, archiving and preservation goals.

-  Support data exchange with global databases, streaming providers, international archives and libraries and rights management organisations.

## Problems

- `🇸🇰  2030 Digital Transformation Strategy` microenterprise and individuals must collect micropayments from hundreds of global platforms---we see that up to 50% of the revenues are not collected. Digitisation of the rights management and payments infrastructure is a huge challenge for any SME, including music businesses.

- Accute shortage of data engineering/science skills: it is not reasonable to expect that all music/CCSI businesses can work with an in-house data engineer or scientist, this makes them vulnerable to global platforms and data companies like Google (owns YouTube and Android payments platform), Apple (owns Apple Music, hardware/payments platform)

## Connecting National Data Collection

- `🇸🇰  Synchronize data development`: Synchronise the current and future needs of rights management organisations, libraries and public archives.

-  Pilot with SOZA, Hudobné centrum and Hudobny Fond.

- Open for Slovak music publishers, music labels, festivals, music promoters.


## Global Connection

- `🌐 🇸🇰  Synchronize data development`: Synchronise automatically global archives, libraries, rights management, MusicBrainz, Wikidata, and other standardised Linked Open Data on the "internet of data" layer of the internet.

-  Pilot with SOZA, Hudobné centrum and Hudobny Fond.
